## 📝 Introduction

# Welcome to Jordi Jaspers' Web Portfolio


👋 Hello there! I'm **Jordi Jaspers**, a seasoned software developer with a passion for crafting efficient and elegant solutions. With 5 years of experience in the world of code, I've developed a knack for turning coffee into code, especially with **Spring Boot**.

When I'm not busy debugging or optimizing, you might find me dabbling in some DevOps magic to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible.

But for now, this repository is all about my web portfolio. Built with **SvelteKit** and **TailwindCSS**, this modern UI is a bento-box of my skills, projects, and achievements. So, grab a cup of coffee, sit back, and explore what I have to offer.

**Website:** https://jordijaspers.dev

### Why work with me?

- 🌟 **Experience**: Five years of hands-on experience in software development. I've seen the good, the bad, and the buggy.
- 💡 **Innovation**: I love coming up with creative solutions to complex problems. Let's just say, I know my way around a tricky `if` statement.
- 🔧 **Tools of the Trade**: Proficient in **Spring Boot**, with a sprinkling of DevOps skills to boot. Whether it's backend development or deployment pipelines, I've got it covered.
- 📈 **Performance**: I believe in writing code that's not just functional but also performant. After all, why settle for `O(n^2)` when you can have `O(n)`?

### A Little Bit About My Journey

It all started with a simple "Hello, World!" and a dream. Over the years, I've worked on numerous projects, each one a new adventure in the vast landscape of software development. From RESTful APIs to cloud infrastructure, I've tackled a variety of challenges, always striving to deliver the best.

But enough about me—let's talk about what I can do for you. Whether you need a robust backend, an efficient microservice, or a seamless CI/CD pipeline, I'm your guy. Let's make your next project a success, one line of code at a time.

So, dive in, explore my work, and if you like what you see, don't hesitate to get in touch. Let's turn those ideas into reality, with a touch of humor and a lot of code.

Happy coding!

🚀 **Jordi Jaspers**
